                Cash Back Tracker is a tool used to track the current amount of cash-back rates
                for some of the most common credit cards in various categories. The categories listed can be thought of as umbrella terms, as the
                actual category being offered by a certain card is a subset of that term (i.e Card A is listed as 5% cashback
                in "Food", but Card A's actual offer is specifically for "Grocery Stores" and does not include "Fast-Food/Restaurants"). These categories
                can still help give you a general idea of which card can be used to get the most out of your cashback offers.
